    <string name="help_part_1_title">Register device for server transaction</string>
    <string name="help_part_1_content">Registering your device is very easy. \n First of all, open the settings via the menu and set your device name (remember the fact to stay anonymous). Then set the server url if you use your own server. Remember to register the device to the server (in order to retrieve your messages from it).\n
    And.... it\'s done. You\'re ready to receive messages (use the refresh button from the Actionbar)</string>
    <string name="help_part_2_title">Sharing public data with friends</string>
    <string name="help_part_2_content">Don\'t forget to send to your friend your device public data : you can use Android Beam to share them OR use the button on the main screen to send them via a third party app.\n Once done, make sure your friend has your device name in his devices list from the second tab</string>
    <string name="help_part_3_title">Send message to friend\'s device</string>
    <string name="help_part_3_content">Two way to send a message.\n
    The first one is to select the device of your friend in the second tab and select it. Then type your message and validate. Your friend can now retrieve the message from the server.\n \n
    Second possibility, when you are in a browser, mail etc... select the message to send, and choose the share option from them. You will see the icon of the app with the title you can send the message to a device server. Select this one (not the other one) and validate the device of your friend. Once again, validate and it\'s done.</string>
    <string name="help_part_4_title">Send an encrypted message to a device via third party apps</string>
    <string name="help_part_4_content">Last but not the least. The app also permits you to transfer from an app, a message, text etc... encrypt it and then select an app to transfer the desired message.\n
    To do so, select a text in an app and then use the share ption from it.\n
    Locate the app icon in the list with the title indicating the use of third party app\n
    Then select your friend device, and click on the button on the right of it to send the encrypted message\n
    Finally, select the final app to send this encrypted message. Your friend will now be able to receive the encrypted message from his mail, etc...</string>
    <string name="help_part_5_title">Notes</string>
    <string name="help_part_5_content">Public infos are bounded to a device, not user\n
    Using the force registering in the options will reset and create new public/private infos so your friends could not be able to send you messages you can unencrypt - remember to warn them\n
    If you have multiple devices, you will be able to unencrypt a message only with the specified device! Not the other ones\n
    \n Remember that the app was supposed to be used to keep privacy... so the sharing options are not supposed to be here to let you keep encrypted message, ensure to delete the mail/sms/everything which carried the message when read! Obviously, when you use the server update messages, the message are deleted server-side WHEN you retrieve them!</string>
